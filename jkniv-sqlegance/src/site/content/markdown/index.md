Title: SQLegance

What is SQLegance?
--------------------

SQLegance is a library for SQL sentence that supports for dynamically append SQL.Â SQLegance put all SQL sentences at XML file, just it. Making the SQL sentence more readable, an better maintenance, like iBatis framework, where the SQL sentence can be dynamics. 


Motivation
--------------------

After a good experience using iBatis and have to move to Hibernate you can feel naked without Dynamic Queries and SQL power. Somebody can say: "Criteria", you can answer, it is not intuitive and a new learning curve begin.

If you are willing to live with query into another file that is not .java, you can enjoy from some good practices adopting SQLegance:

- No concatenate strings to build a SQL;
- SQL clear to test/debug/troubleshooting is a relief;
- Java code clean to build query without if/else from input parameters from user interface;
- Use fully database power with SQL to make applications faster;

The advantage to use SQLegance it's that can be adopted to your current project using frameworks like Hibernate, EclipseLink, Spring or JDBC easily, because SQLegance is not ORM or handle `java.sql.*` classes. SQLegance just keep your queries (native SQL, JPQL, HQL etc) in XML files, independently from framework.

This framework helps us to keep the code clean kicking the SQL code to XML files and keeping business logic to java, facilitating your maintenance.
