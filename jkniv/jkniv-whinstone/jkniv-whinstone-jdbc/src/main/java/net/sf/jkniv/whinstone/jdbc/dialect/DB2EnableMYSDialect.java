/**
 * Dialect to DB2 with compatibility features for MySQL applications.
 * <p>
 *  Limit clause:
 *  <code>select name from author LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2</code>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Supports limits? true</li>
 *  <li>Supports limit off set? true</li>
 *  <li>Supports rownum? false</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 *<p>
 * The DB2_COMPATIBILITY_VECTOR registry variable enables one or more DB2Â® compatibility features. 
 * These features ease the task of migrating applications that were written for relational database 
 * products other than the DB2 product to DB2 Version 9.5 or later.
 *</p>
 *<p>
 * This registry variable is supported on Linux, UNIX, and Windows operating systems.
 * You can enable individual DB2 compatibility features by specify a hexadecimal value 
 * for the registry variable. Each bit in the variable value enables a different feature. Values are as follows:
 *</p>
 *<pre>
 *   NULL (default)
 *   0000 - FFFF
 *   ORA, to take full advantage of the DB2 compatibility features for Oracle applications
 *   SYB, to take full advantage of the DB2 compatibility features for Sybase applications
 *   MYS, to take full advantage of the DB2 compatibility features for MySQL applications
 *</pre>
